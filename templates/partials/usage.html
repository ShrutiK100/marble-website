                <p>Marble provides an all-in-one data catalog and development environment hosted by a member of the
                    Marble network. Using web processing services tailored for climate analysis, Marble
                    is great for those getting started in climate research. Data stored on the Marble network can be accessed by all users, no
                    matter where it is hosted.  All data storage and data processing are done on the Marble platform.  No need to
                    ensure your laptop has enough storage or computing power. </p>

                <p>Marble uses JupyterLab as its development environment.  JupyterLab lets you create self-contained
                    notebooks that can access datasets stored on Marble's STAC catalog, and conduct data analysis using tools such as
                    data science oriented Python packages.</p>

            <p>A large part of being a researcher is lots of nitty-gritty work.  Long hours of analyzing data, creating and
                modifying workflows, and collaborating with other researchers are the norm.</p>

            <p>Marble takes the storage and processing requirements out of the user's hands by
                providing a convenient single location to access the analytical software and data.
                Using a familiar JupyterLab development environment, researchers can access web processing services that
                implement OGCAPI, the key part of "moving the application to the data".  The Weaver web processing service
                allows workflows to be created that can chain other web processing services, such as Finch and Raven,
                and execute them on the Marble platform where the data is already stored.
            </p>
            <p>Marble provides avenues for sharing and collaboration.  Workflows and results created on Marble, or
                uploaded to the platform, can be made public to others on the network and be easily discoverable by
                like-minded colleagues.</p>

            <p>Marble is great for those curious about climate science.  The JupyterLab work environment comes with
            Jupyter kernels prepackaged with tools geared towards climate data analysis.  </p>

            <p>Explore our STAC data catalog and use the Birdhouse series of analytical tools.  Examine climate indicies using
                Finch.  Perform a hydrological analysis using Raven.  Run multiple analyses by chaining the processes
                with Weaver.
            </p>
            <p>Our tutorials will guide you in using these tools and the Marble platform, and get you started in no time.</p>
